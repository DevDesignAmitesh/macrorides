## Vendor app whole structure ( high level )
( this is according to me, kindly talk with AI and get to know more aboute the frontend )
( and the code should be clean, readable and not extra files for no reasons )

- Context on the frontend
  - For vendor auth status like vendor basic details like id, name, phone number
  - For vendor orders
  - For vendor profile
  - For vendor analytics

- Pages on the frontend
  - Landing page
  - Signup page
  - Login page
  - Dashboard page
  - Inventory page
  - Settings page
  - Profile page
  - Analytics page
  - Orders page
  - Single order page ( for live tracking and for normal viewing the previous order )
